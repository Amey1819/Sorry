<h1>Please don’t go 😭❤️</h1>

<p>
If you’re here, it means you’re still upset… and honestly I deserve that.  
But please don’t shut me out completely.  
You’re too important to me. Every second without you feels empty.  
I’m not perfect, I make mistakes, but my love for you has always been real.  
Give me one more chance to fix things, to make you smile again, to be the person you fell for.  
I’ll wait… because you’re worth waiting forever. 💔❤️
