<h1>Our Memories 🥺✨</h1>

<p>
All those late-night talks when we didn’t even realize time passing…  
those silly jokes that made us laugh like kids…  
the random “I miss you” texts… the way you say my name…  
Every small thing with you feels magical.  
You turned ordinary days into beautiful memories.  
And honestly… life without you feels incomplete. You’re not just someone I love… you’re my comfort, my peace, my home. ❤️
