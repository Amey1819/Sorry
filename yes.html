<h1>I LOVE YOU ISHU ❤️✨</h1>

<p>
I don’t even have enough words to explain how much you mean to me.  
You’re my happiness on bad days, my smile when everything feels heavy, my safe place when the world gets loud.  
Talking to you feels like home, like peace, like everything is finally okay.  
I fall for you a little more every single day… your voice, your kindness, your cute anger, your laugh, everything.  
I don’t just want you today… I want you tomorrow, next year, forever.  
Thank you for being mine, for loving me, for choosing me.  
I promise to protect your heart always. You’re my forever person. 💕🥺🌸
